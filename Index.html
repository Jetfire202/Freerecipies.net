        <h1>The Best Tuna Salad</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Two 6-ounce cans white meat tuna packed in water, drained

            2 tablespoons minced celery,
            
            2 tablespoons minced red onion, soaked in cold water for 5 minutes and drained,
            
            1 teaspoon minced flat-leaf parsley,
            
            1/3 cup prepared mayonnaise,
            
            1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard,
            
            Freshly ground black pepper,
            
            Freshly squeezed lemon juice (optional).</p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>In a small mixing bowl break up the tuna with a fork. Toss with the celery, onion and parsley. Add the mayonnaise, mustard and season with pepper, to taste. Stir to combine. Add lemon juice, to taste, if using. </p>
            <h2>Cooks Note </h2>
            <p>Substitute 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard for the whole-grain mustard and add 2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish.</p>
            <h1> Perfect French fries</h1>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>5 pounds russet potatoes,

                Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying,
                
                Sea salt</p>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <p>Peel and rinse the potatoes. Then cut them into sticks by cutting the potato in 4 or 5 vertical pieces, and then cutting each piece into sticks. 
                    Place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Allow them to soak, 2 to 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak overnight.) 
                    When you're ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes on 2 baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot with paper towels to dry them. 
                    Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot to 300 degrees F. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. They should not be brown at this point! You just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain on new/dry paper towels. 
                    Once all the potatoes have been fried at 300 degrees F, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. When the oil's hot, start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp. Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain on paper towels. 
                    Sprinkle with sea salt and dive in!</p>
                    <h1>Snow cone</h1>
                    <h2>What you will need:</h2>
                    <p>A water-tight ziplock bag,
                        A rolling pin or a mallet,
                        Water</p>
                        <h2>Steps</h2>
                        <p>Fill around ¼ of the ziplock with water (or flavored water) and tightly seal the bag before letting it freeze in the fridge. Make sure that the bag is laying flat on the surface. Once frozen, the ice’s flat shape can make the crushing process easier.
                            Once the ice is ready, pound and crush the ice with the use of a rolling pin, a mallet or any hard kitchen tool that you can use for pounding.
                            Pound the ice continuously until you get your desired texture and consistency.
                            Afterwards, mound the ice in a bowl and add syrup, condensed milk or other flavorings and toppings.</p>
                            <h1>Ice cream</h1>
                            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                            <p>¾ cup white sugar
                                1 cup heavy whipping cream
                                2 ¼ cups milk
                                2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
                                <h2>Directions</h2>
                                <p>Step 1
                                    Stir sugar, cream, and milk into a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until mix is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.
                                    <br>
                                     Step 2
                                    Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)
                                    <br>
                                     Step 3
                                    Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.
                                    <br>
                                     Step 4
                                    When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
